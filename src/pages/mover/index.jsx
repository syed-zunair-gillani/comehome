                                        So you google "movers in my city" and open the first 5 tabs. The first one looks fine, so you click "Get a quote." Uhg, 10 fields to fill out. Where from, where to, email, phone, # of rooms. You complete them and click "Submit quote" - but you don't get a quote. It says "We'll call you." You close the tab.  <br /><br />
                                        Next moving company's website says "Get an instant estimate with your phone." You click the button and it explains you can get an instant estimate customized to YOUR stuff - just by walking around your house with the camera on. 5 minutes later you have an estimate range that's about what you expected and you're told to expect a precise quote tomorrow morning. Ok great, you close the tab. <br /><br />
                                        Next moving company's website wants you to fill out 10 fields again - forget that, time to watch Netflix. Close the tabs and relax. <br /><br />
                                        The next morning, you get two experiences.  Moving company #2 calls you personally and leaves a voicemail saying "Hi, I looked over your survey and made a couple improvements to the inventory. We're specialists at handling pianos like yours, so we're glad you came to us. I'm sending over a precise quote right now - let's get you taken care of."  <br /><br />
                                        Moving company #1 robocalls you 10 times a day. When you finally pick up the phone, they want to set up time during business hours next week to walk through your house. <br /><br />

                                        And despite all the years you spent on SEO and money you spent on ads, customers bounce off your website - as high as 90% of the customers on your website never contact you.<br /><br />
                                        And it's no surprise. Filling out 10 fields and then getting robocalled 10 times a day is a lousy experience. It sucks for customers and you know it, but what other choice do you have?  <br /><br />
                                        First impressions are everything, and the estimate and quoting process is their first experience with your team. <br /><br />
